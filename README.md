That's where Twitter **Bootstrap** comes in. The folks over at Twitter created _a powerful framework that makes front-end development easier and quicker_. And it's simple (and free!) to use on your own website. When you integrate Bootstrap into your application, your buttons, links, nav bars, and other common HTML elements get a massive face lift. Suddenly you've got a standards compliant, professionally-built, user-friendly, and responsive website.
